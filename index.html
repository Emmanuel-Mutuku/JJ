    <h1>The Jani Journey Organisation</h2>

    <h3><em>The Story Behind it</em>.</h3>
      <p>Ever since some of the Jani  Journey members got opportunities to tour the world they came back with one similar thing; EXPOSURE! Some even thought that the young generation back at home has no future at all since everyone is being taught how to compete with one another so as to secure opportunities instead of collaborating with one another so as to create opportunities.</p>
      <p>The Alumni of The Alliance High School, The Alliance Girls High School, The Kenya High School & The Kapsabet Boys High School thought of a way of improvising on the orthodox methods of mentorship that most of the time are not effective to the young generation.( What we call the normal boring talks) Through activities, the young can actually benefit more in almost all aspects and develop in better ways so as to be able to stand on their own with Independent and Realistic mindsets. We simply came up with a program that is based on what we call the 5Câ€™s( Choice, Communication, Critical Thinking, Collaboration, & Creativity) These are simply the Values we use to make a better generation.</p>
      <p>The Program simply takes up individuals with so much HIDDEN potential and makes the potential visible by bettering others. The question is how do we do this? We enroll people aged between 13 and 17 into our program whereby they are taken through short courses for self realization after which evaluation is done and one is taken to the other level which involves Self Expression and application into some of these abroad Exchange Programs that we are talking about : Yale Young Global Scholars, Yale Young African Scholars, Students For The Advancement Of Global Entrepreneurship, Barrack Obama Leadership Program, Stanford High School Summer Session & The Experiment Of International Living.</p>
